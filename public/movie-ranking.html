<h1>Top 3 Best Spirit Telephone Songs </h1>
<h2>by Lemon Demon (according to Ana)</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Lifetime Achievement Award</h3>
<p>A modern day critical look at celebrity worship culture through the lens of developing gene cloning technology. The tone of the song is humourous and yet terrifying, forcing us to question the morality of the "legend status", and what is means to the human being being objectified. Reminicent of the Gothic Classic "Frankensteins Monster."</p>
<h3>I Earn My Life</h3>
<p>As a continuation of the previous track "As Your Father I Expressly Forbid It", this song shows the perspective of the Father figure of the story. His opinion of himself being always right, is smothered by the feeling of dread as it seems his negative view on life has been cultivated though sceptisizm and critisizm of himself by his own father figure. His stubberness highlighted by the double entendre "I'm standing on a chair" - perfectly reveals the double meaning of the song. Not being able to sit down from stubberness and not feeling worthy of it, and the symbolism of standing on a chair to hang oneself. Inter-generational trauma thinly veiled with a typical "dad" attitude.</p>
<h3>Redesign Your Logo</h3>
<p>As a designer, I am aware of the predictability of this choice, however the fascination of the original Pepsi document shows through the tone of the song - as it cannot be masked even by the lighthearted mockery of graphic design as a whole. We know the author as being a designer himself,as such it feels more like a conversation, a inner-monelogue of self-awareness of the current state of corperate design. Or maybe the pepsi document is bonkers, and that's hilarious.</p>
